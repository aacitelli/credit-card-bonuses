## credit-card-offers-api

⚡ Free API for current credit card offers ⚡

We allow data exporting in several formats. Simply visit the following pages in your browser and download the resulting page.

- **JSON** - `https://jo0g96wiy5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/json`
- **CSV** - `https://jo0g96wiy5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/csv`

The companion site for this is [Offer Optimist](https://offeroptimist.com). It comes with tons of filters, valuation settings, and much more, and is a great first approach to comparing all the different cards out there. Give it a try!

### Features

- **JSON + CSV Export:** - You can get the data in either format.
- **OpenAPI Spec:** - To see the exact format for what we'll return, you can view our OpenAPI / Swagger spec at `src/api.yaml`. For a nice UI, I recommend you go to https://editor.swagger.io/, then File > Import URL, then paste in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aacitelli/credit-card-bonuses-api/main/src/api.yaml.

### Support

I pay for the server time and development cost for this entirely out of my own pocket. If you'd like to support me, you can support me with the "Sponsor" options on the right or by using one of the referral links on [Offer Optimist](https://offeroptimist.com), which I get a kickback for. Thank you for your support!

### Contributing

I highly encourage PRs or Issues for data updates. If you see an offer is out of date, create an issue or fix the issue yourself with a PR and I'll be happy to merge it in.

### License

This project is under the MIT License with an added [Commons Clause](https://commonsclause.com/). In effect, these two items mean that you can do whatever you like with the project _as long as_ your derived work is not sold commercially. I make this available with the intent of enabling hobbyists to use it as they wish, not to try and get in some long-term business deal that implies support, SLAs, and more on my part.
